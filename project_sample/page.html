        One bird species particularly affected by climate change is the
        beautiful Painted Redstart.This small songbird is native to Arizona,
        Texas, New Mexico and Mexico. With a black body, bright red belly and
        white stripe on its wings and tail, the Painted Redstart can be found
        nesting on steep hillsides or in ledge crevices. When foraging, they
        flash their tail and wings to scare insects out into the open. This
        unique bird breeds in mixed oak and pine forests, which are
        unfortunately threatened by climate change and deforestation.

          In the southwestern United States, climate change
          often takes the form of wildfires. In 2017, around 430,000 acres were
          destroyed by wildfires in Arizona alone. Temperatures in this area are
          projected to increase drastically, causing more droughts and
          heatwaves, decimating the Painted Redstart's habitat.
